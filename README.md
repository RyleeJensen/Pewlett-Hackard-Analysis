# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is large company that has been around for some time; they have quite a few employees. There are many people employed here whom are baby-boomers and are on the brink of retirement. Because there are soon to be thousands of job openings, Pewlett Hackard needs to start thinking towards the future and plan for all the upcoming vacancies. Our analysis is to help them with this program. Mainly answering a few questions, such as how many people are retiring and who exactly is retiring. We also figured out the number of retiring employees per title and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Summary
As we can see from the analysis above, Pewlett Hackard needs to be very prepared and ready for all the upcoming retirements. There will be a lot of vacancies to fill and not only that, but a lot of training for these new positions as well. If the company is proactive, it would be a good idea for them to start hiring new staff prematurely so that they can get some mentorship from those who have been at the company a long time. On top of hiring new people, it would also be a good idea for Pewlett Hackard to have a sense of who is due for a raise or promotion. As others retire, instead of hiring outside the company, they can promote people inside. This would reduce the amount of training needed and would boost company morale.
